## Create Interactive Map i Leaflet

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)
gs4_deauth()
```


## Task 1: Create a Danish equivalent of AUSmap with esri layers, but call it DANmap
```{r}
l_dan <- leaflet() %>% 
  setView(10.2083063,56.1568947, zoom=13)

esri <- grep("^Esri", providers, value = TRUE)  

for (provider in esri) {
  l_dan <- l_dan %>% addProviderTiles(provider, group = provider)
}

DANmap <- l_dan %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups = names(esri),
                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) %>%
  addMiniMap(tiles = esri[[1]], toggleDisplay = TRUE,
             position = "bottomright") %>%
  addMeasure(
    position = "bottomleft",
    primaryLengthUnit = "meters",
    primaryAreaUnit = "sqmeters",
    activeColor = "#3D535D",
    completedColor = "#7D4479") %>% 
  htmlwidgets::onRender("
                        function(el, x) {
                        var myMap = this;
                        myMap.on('baselayerchange',
                        function (e) {
                        myMap.minimap.changeLayer(L.tileLayer.provider(e.name));
                        })
                        }") %>% 
  addControl("", position = "topright")

DANmap
```
## ADD DATA TO LEAFLET

### In this section you will manually create machine-readable spatial data from GoogleMaps: 

### First, go to https://bit.ly/CreateCoordinates1
Enter the coordinates of your favorite leisure places in Denmark 
extracting them from the URL in googlemaps, adding name and type of monument.
Remember to copy the coordinates as a string, as just two decimal numbers separated by comma. 

Caveats: Do NOT edit the grey columns! They populate automatically!

## Second, read the sheet into R. You will need gmail login information. 
watch the console, it may ask you to authenticate or put in the number 
that corresponds to the account you wish to use.

## Read in a Google sheet

```{r}
places <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PlxsPElZML8LZKyXbqdAYeQCDIvDps2McZx1cTVWSzI/edit#gid=124710918",
                     col_types = "cccnncnc",range="DigitalMethods")
glimpse(places)
```
# load the coordinates in the map and check: are any points missing? Why?

```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description)
```
## Task 2: Read in the googlesheet data you and your colleaguespopulated with data into the DANmap object you created in Task 1.

```{r}
DANmap %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude,
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description)
```

## Task 3: Can you cluster the points in Leaflet? Google "clustering options in Leaflet"
```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```

## Task 4: Look at the map and consider what it is good for and what not.
Considering Denmark as a small country it is clustering markers which seems far apart, for example Skagen and Aarhus are clustered in the same point.
And therefore it gives ana wrong impression of how the points are scattered on the map. The clusering would be useful on a larger geographical map. Or if it clustered smaller groups of markers and thereby created smaller and several cluster-groups. 


## Task 5: Find out how to display notes and classifications in the map.
```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```

I already created a popup=places$Description, which shows the descriptions from the spreadsheet in a note box, when clicking on a marker
Therefore each marker has their own description, which are the descriptions written in the spreadsheet
